		   What is Vim?^M
^M
Vim is a Unix text editor that's included in Linux, BSD, and macOS. It's known for being fast and efficient, in part because it's a small application that can run in a terminal (although it also has a graphical interface), but mostly because it can be controlled entirely with the keyboard with no need for menus or a mouse. For instance, to insert text into a file, you press I and type. To navigate or to issue a command (such as Save, Backspace, Home, End, and so on), you press Esc on your keyboard and then press whatever key or key combination corresponds with the action you want to take. It's a very different way of editing text compared to what modern computer users expect, but it's the way Unix admins all over the world edit config files, changelogs, scripts, and more.^M
